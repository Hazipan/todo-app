## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to react-beautiful-dnd to create a very nice drag and drop experience


### Continued development

From here I'm planning to go back to previous projects and spruce them up. Once I do that, I'm going to build a portfolio website, do a few other key projects, and begin applying for front-end development jobs.
